Hello.

My name is Jeremy.

I created this website because there aren’t many resources for advanced CompuCell developers, except the excellent (though sometimes limited) manuals. My goal was to fill in some gaps in documentation – gaps that I have overcome, but with more difficulty than I feel should be necessary.

These include:

- [Manipulating the Energy Term for Pixel Flip Attempts](/ppip/)
- [Developing Plugins](/part1/)
- [The theoretical underpinnings of the software (e.g. what is a Monte-Carlo step? What is a pixel flip attempt? How do Python and C++ interact?)](/theory/)

You’ll see, this is a fairly limited project. Most resources the typical modeler will need can be found in the reference and scripting manual. Some methods, though, lack documentation altogether – despite how useful and powerful they are. I hope to shed some light on them.
